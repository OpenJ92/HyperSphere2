# HyperSphere2

A module levering Numpy, Pythonâ€™s OOP suite and concepts of Metaprogramming to construct hyper-
spheres and their n-derivatives in any M-dimensional space. We then define additive and multiplicative
Operations on these spheres in the context of single variable polynomials. The goal of this project is to
numerically inspect the topological properties of these objects and have them ready for use in Gradient
Descent algorithms over non-differentiable fields.
